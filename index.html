                About Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                My interest in electronics and programming stems from my studies at         KTH and time spent working as a software developer consultant. In           addition to working with frameworks such as React and Vue, I have           experience in OOP and functional programming. Through my experience         with various consultancy projects, I have worked in collaborative and       agile development environments.
                <br>
                <br>
                Having developed both web applications as well as mobile applications,       I am a full stack developer with keen interest in front end and             exposure to back end development. Aspects of challenges and problem         solving fuel my passion as a developer. It is my vision to create           something that enables people to accomplish their tasks more                 efficiently or simplifies their lives.
